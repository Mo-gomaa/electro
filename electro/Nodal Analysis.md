Nodal analysis is a fundamental technique used in electronics for analyzing and solving electrical circuits. It's based on Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), which states that the sum of currents entering a node (or junction) in a circuit must equal the sum of currents leaving that node. 

Here's a basic overview of how nodal analysis works:

1. **Identify Nodes**: Nodes are points in the circuit where multiple elements (resistors, capacitors, etc.) connect. Each node except one is assigned a variable (usually voltage) which is relative to a reference node (often chosen as ground).

2. **Apply KCL**: At each node (except the reference or ground node), write an equation applying KCL. This equation will state that the sum of currents entering the node is equal to the sum of currents leaving the node.

3. **Write Equations**: Express each current in terms of the nodal voltages and the component values using Ohm's Law (for resistors) or relevant equations for other components.

4. **Solve Equations**: You'll end up with a set of equations, usually linear, that relate the nodal voltages to each other. Solve these equations simultaneously to find the voltages at all the nodes.

5. **Analyze Circuit**: Once you have the nodal voltages, you can use them to find other circuit parameters such as currents through components or power dissipation.

Nodal analysis is particularly useful for solving circuits with multiple voltage sources and complex configurations. It's a powerful tool in circuit design and analysis because it can handle circuits with both dependent and independent sources.
